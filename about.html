            <p>
                Beth and Jen meet in 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia. People always ask how we met,<br> and everyones loves a good story, but the short version is; we survived a cult together.<br> The best part through the trauma we endured, was walking away from it with a best friend<br> and sister for life. We were wives, mothers, providers, caretakers and spent our free time<br> hosting parties and events for friends and family. Between the both of us, we share 40<br> combined years of in the food and hospitality industry representing various positions,<br> including culinary and management. In 2018, Jen joined the film industry and talked to me<br> about it passionately, until I finally caved and joined her the following year. In 2019,<br> Jen proposed that we start a craft services company for the film industry and go into<br> business together doing what we know how to do best; take care of and love the people<br> around us. So, we put our heads and hearts together, purchased a food trailer and are<br> living our dream!
